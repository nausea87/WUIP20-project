## Code review

- great job splitting your js/ scss files, maybe you could've made separate files for media queries and animations for easier access
- the button doesn't have pointer cursor on hover
- the social media links aren't really links...I really wanted to click on them :') 
- text in footer overflows/ isn't really readable in desktop view
- nice work with the svgs, the site looks great :)
